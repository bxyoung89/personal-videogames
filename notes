There's a system discrepancy in backloggery: Superfamicom should be it's own system. Same with Giant Bomb. Famicom is it's own system for some reason.
A couple games didn't have data so I didn't count it.
Also don't care if it's a downloadable game or not.
Some games have bad dates.
Explain Backloggery statuses
Games are based off of their first release ever (hence some of the older entries)
Oldest games are probably 10-yard fight, baseball, duck hunt, golf, gyromite, hogan's alley, pinball, and super mario bros. But actual is probably Gyromite since I have a 5 screw version.
Latest game is Octopath Traveler
